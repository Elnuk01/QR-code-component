## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Responsiveness


### What I learned

During this project I was able to learn more about styling with CSS and proper structuring with HTML.

In the structuring I first had issues with knowing which component should have a div on it own and which component should be together in a div, but I figured it out finally which made it easier for me to style.
```html
<div class="para">
  <p class="p1">Improve your front-end skills by building projects</p>
  <p class="p2">Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills to the next level</p>
</div>


```
At first I seperated the above paragraph into different divs which gave me issues styling, but I figured I could still put them in same div and just give them a different class name.

Well the css wasn't much of an issue the moment I properly structured the html. I got to learn how to style for different screen sizes making it responsive, at first I didn't the function to enter before styling for diiferent screens then I found out the below function to style screens. 
```css
@media screen and (max-width: 576px) {}
```

### Continued development

I need to understand more and go even deeper in structuring with html. styling and responsiveness with css.
